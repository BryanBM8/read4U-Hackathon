Read4U

This project was developed in the framework of our participation in the Hackathon competition organized by Binus University and Microsoft. The project we designed is Read4U. Read4U is an idea development to help deaf people in reading. This project provides two main features, namely the utilization of OCR and Text to Speech to voice a writing that is around the user so that the user does not need to bother to read using braille. In addition, another feature is the availability of an integrated book database without doing text detection again. This development idea can also be adjusted to user preferences such as language (Indonesian and English) and voiced by men or women.
